When she is not on the podcast, she enjoys commuting to work via bike, spending time with Yoshi, cooking then eating, lots of sleep and occasional yoga and making small-batch artisan ice cream. Her short stature and below average bike size has deterred many a LA bike thieves-- evidence that it pay off to be short."
